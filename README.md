# LoST: Legend of Silence Tribute

## Inspiration

LoST is loosely based on a fictional video game described in the short story *Navigators* by Mike Meginnis. The game is described as being similar to Nintendo's *Metroid* for the NES, with a twist: the protagonist becomes weaker as the player progresses through the game.
